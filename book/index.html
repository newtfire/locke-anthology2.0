<figcaption><p class="caption_p">This is the book "The New Negro, an interpretation", which contains many different Poems and music sheets which we used to
    to bring it's written content to life. This  volume  aims  to  document  the  New  Negro  culturally and  socially, â€” to  register  the  transformations
    of  the  inner  and outer  life  of  the  Negro  in
    America  that  have  so  significantly taken  place  in  the  last  few  year.</p> </figcaption>
