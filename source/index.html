    <p>The Locke Anthology Project applies <a href="https://tei-c.org/">TEI XML</a> and static web technologies in an effort to construct a digital edition of 
        Alain Lockeâ€™s anthology <i>The New Negro: An Interpretation</i> (1925). The project is a collaboration of Profs. Bartholomew Brinkman and Elisa Beshero-Bondar 
        together with their students at Framingham State University and Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, and is
        inspired by their participation in the <a href="https://digitalethnicfutures.org/">Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium (DEFCon)</a> with thanks to Roopika Risam.</p>
