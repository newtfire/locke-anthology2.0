    <p>This project is an effort to construct a digital edition of <i>The New Negro: An Interpretation</i>, 
        edited by Alain Locke (1925). The project is a collaboration between Profs. Bartholomew Brinkman and Elisa Beshero-Bondar 
        and their students at Framingham State University and Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, 
        inspired by their collaboration in the <a href="https://digitalethnicfutures.org/">Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium (DEFCon)</a> with thanks to Roopika Risam.</p>
